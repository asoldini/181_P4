# This is the Readme File for my practical code:

`stub.py` contains the code for my Q-learning agent. This code is not particularly set up for a iterative procedure. In other words, I manually changed the parameters between runs of the code. The outputs were lists of scores, and or gravities. 

`cats.py` was a file that contains some of the code that I used to produce the graphs for this assignment and to analyze the output scores a bit.
