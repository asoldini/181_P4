# CS 181 Practical 4: Q-Learning Swingy Monkey:

This practical assignment was one in which I implemented a Q-Learning agent to play a game similar to the well-known game Flappy-Bird, called Swingy-Monkey. 

`stub.py` contains the code for my Q-learning agent. This code is not particularly set up for a iterative procedure. In other words, I manually changed the parameters between runs of the code. The outputs were lists of scores, and or gravities. 

`cats.py` was a file that contains some of the code that I used to produce the graphs for this assignment and to analyze the output scores a bit.
